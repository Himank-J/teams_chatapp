<br />
Microsoft Teams is one of the most popular business communication platform being used all over the world. With the pandemic over our heads, Teams platform has become the new classroom for many school/college students. One of the great features of the Teams app is the chat interface it provides.<br /> **This project is an implementation of the microsoft teams chat feature where users can send messages to other individuals or a group.**<br/>
### **Features -**<br />
* Users can send many to each other or on a group
* Users have the ability to send images on chat
* Admin can add other members to a group
* A small scaled user profile picture appears below seen messages (refer below screenshots)
* Small message tone can be heard when user sends a message 


### Built With
This application is built with love, dedication, coffee and:
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Chat engine](https://chatengine.io/) <br />
React is a javascript library used for building user interface and Chat engine is a service which offers API for implementing chat features in any application. Chat engine is used to take care of backend services such as a user profile creation or creating an admin or a group. Services of chat engine are incorporated into react using API provided by chat engine.<br />

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
